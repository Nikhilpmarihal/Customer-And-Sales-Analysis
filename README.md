Customer and Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau

This project presents a comprehensive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze customer behavior and sales performance across two distinct regions Europe and Non Europe. The dashboard delivers data driven insights that support strategic decision making, operational efficiency, and market level benchmarking.

Project Overview

The objective of this project is to consolidate customer and sales data into an interactive analytics layer that enables business users to evaluate performance trends, identify growth opportunities, and compare regional behaviors. Using two datasets Europe and Non Europe, the dashboard uncovers patterns in revenue, customer segments, product categories, and regional contribution.

The solution leverages core Tableau capabilities including data blending, calculated fields, dynamic filters, custom KPIs, and interactive drill down functionalities.
